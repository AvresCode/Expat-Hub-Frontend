# About this project

Expat hub is a full stack web app for expats and other people who want to socialize and explore new places and cultures by joining different events. </br></br>
I made this app with all the different tech I learned during bootcamp course at Codaisseur and some extra knowledge from different resources. </br>


## Features

A user can see all events, ordered by date, on homepage and see the details of each event on detail page of that event. They can also search event based on title and date on homepage.</br></br>
When logged in, a user can accept or decline the event. Also he/she is able to change his/her status of going at any time. (on both homepage and detail page of the event)</br></br>
On the details page of each event, a user, when logged in, can write comment or post a photo. Also, he/she  can see a list of members attending specific event and clicking on each member goes to the details page of that member. </br></br>
On members page, a user can see a list of all members of the website and he/she can go to the detail page of each member.</br></br>
A user when logged in can see my page link on navbar and in my page she/he can : </br>
*	Edit profile
*	Create event (if the user is ambassador)
*	Edit the event that he/she created
*	Delete the event that he/she created
*	See his/her upcoming events
*	See his/her past events
</br>
Not completed feature: </br>
A user when logged in can see a message button on each member profile and send message to that member. At the moment, this feature is not completed as the message opens a general chat room between all online users but it’s not between two users / not connected with the id’s!  </br>
